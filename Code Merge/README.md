## Code Merge (Exercise 2)

#### Overview

There are two different ways that was implemented. One way conserved our code's original behavior,
meaning that the other code's invocation method was changed, while the other way preserved both
behavior but relies on a facade module to invoke any of the group's modules (or any additional
groups for that matter).

Simple Code => Preservation of behavior

Template Code => Preservation of group's code
